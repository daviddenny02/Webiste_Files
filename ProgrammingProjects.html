                Java Minesweeper is a simple project that had the main objectives of understanding the Java <br>
                programming language and the numerous Object-Oriented Programming concepts therein. In order to <br>
                achieve these goals, I implemented the iconic game Minesweeper in Java. OOP concepts were used <br>
                throughout the project, ensuring my understanding of concepts like Exception Handling, Instance <br>
                Lists, File Handling, and Encapsulation. The program offers a user-friendly interface and <br>
                functional gameplay.<br><br>
        
                This project allowed for some group collaboration. As Team Lead and Lead Programmer, I was <br>
                responsible for developing nearly all aspects of the program while also assisting team members <br>
                with documentation. This project allowed us to take the idea from initial concept to completion.<br><br>

                As mentioned, the Minesweeper program contains various instances of OOP and Java concepts <br>
                throughout. A brief description of the project’s code can be found below in the embedded slides, <br>
                describing these various concepts in greater detail. Please also refer to the live demo at the <br>
                website’s homepage, in which you can interact with this program in a live environment!
              </p>

            <div class="section-box" style="width: 900px;">

              </div>
              <p>
                The code is fairly self explanatory and well-commented. For clarity, the below slides and logic <br>
                diagrams touch on the functionality of our Minesweeper program, and how to play it. Specifically, <br>
                the logic diagrams detail the primary logic for the functions navigated by the user’s inputs. <br>
                Additionally, the entire project’s code, consolidated into one file, can be found at the download <br>
                link below. A JavaScript varient of this program can aldo be found in this zipped folder.<br>
                These files can also be found in my GitHub:<br>

                The Java Minesweeper project successfully met its objectives by demonstrating a strong <br>
                understanding of Java and key Object-Oriented Programming concepts. Through effective <br>
                implementation and collaboration, the program achieved a fully functional and user-friendly <br>
                Minesweeper game. The project not only reinforced fundamental programming skills but also <br>
                provided hands-on experience in software development, documentation, and team coordination. <br>
                Ultimately, this project served as a valuable learning experience.
