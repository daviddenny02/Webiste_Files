                This project involved the creation of custom system calls within a simplified operating system.
                The xv6 Operating System has the benefit of being both simplified and open-source. This means
                that the system is well-documented and useful for better understanding the structure and
                functionality of operating systems in general. This project has the goal of implementing
                customized system calls at the kernel level of an operating system, which adds additional
                functions or system calls for a user to use at the user level.

                The system calls added in this project include the following functions. Note that to implement
                these system calls, multiple attributes of processes in the xv6 Operating System were added.
                Notably, this includes a color attribute and tickets attribute:<br><br>

                <i><b>int setColor(enum COLOR)</b></i> –- This system call assigns a color to a process when passed a
                valid enum color.<br>
                <i><b>int setTickets(int)</b></i> –- This system call assigns a number of tickets to a process, which can be
                utilized in a lottery scheduler. Child processes inherit their parent’s number of tickets,
                if a child process were created.<br>
                <i><b>int getpinfo(struct pstat *)</b></i> –- This system call returns information pertaining to a process’
                attributes. This system call allows us to ensure that ticket values and colors were correctly assigned.<br><br>

                A user-space test program was also created to call each of these system calls from the user space
                and verify their operation. As mentioned, the xv6 Operating System is altered to add these
                additional system calls, and requires changing many of the files throughout the system’s entire
                directory. This includes declaring and instantiating many values within the kernel space of the
                operating system.<br><br>

                A full list of the changed files can be found below. For brevity’s sake, the files that implement and test
                the added system calls are the only files included in the below download link. Further explanations of the
                flies' relevance to the project can be found in the zipped folder’s README. This code can be found on my
                GitHub page if desired.

                This project involved the creation of my own, simple Unix shell. The shell is a fundamental
                component of interfacing with the Unix environment, and this project has the goal of understanding
                how modern shells function. This project allowed me to familiarize myself with the Linux programming
                environment and understand the creation, destruction, and management of processes in operating
                systems. All of these concepts enabled me to understand and create a fully functionally Unix shell.<br><br>

                Specifically, my shell, otherwise known as a Command line Interpreter, implements the standard Unix
                commands you would expect out of a command line interface. This includes running test files, navigating
                directories, and exiting when desired using fork(), execv(), and more. This project is foundational to
                my understanding of Operating Systems.
