                This project implements a feature-complete, simple Real-Time Operating System. This RTOS<br>
                is created from scratch and driven using a Texas Instruments’ TM4C123GXL Red Board and its<br>
                accompanying microcontroller. Through the use of an UART connection, users can interact with<br>
                the RTOS, which runs multiple sample tasks and threads at the same time, performing quick,<br>
                efficient context switches and requisite memory protection of the Kernel and User Space.

              This page will document the features implemented and available in the RTOS, including the Embedded Systems<br>
              concepts that were applied and tested with it. As previously descibed, the RTOS is run with a TI microprocessor,<br>
              and uses some external hardware in the form of LEDs and Push Buttons for testing and I/O integration experience.<br>
              Also previously described, the primary form of communication between a user and the RTOS is via a UART<br>
              connection, and the various screenshots provided are from the shell implemented with it. With that context in<br>
              mind, here are the features available in the RTOS:

        <div class="container">
          <div class="section-box" style="width: 1050px;">
            <div class="title-bar">

              <b>Shell Interface:</b> Using the UART connection, a shell is implemented, capturing user inputs and interpreting<br>
              those inputs as RTOS commands. These commands include the ability to run/kill tasks, check the status of the RTOS<br>
              with common Linux commands like ps() and ipcs(), reboot the RTOS, etc. The shell is perhaps the most important<br>
              tasks included with the RTOS.<br><br>

              <b>Preemptive and Cooperative Enforcement:</b> The RTOS can operate in both a Cooperative and Preemptive mode,<br>
              toggled using another Shell command. In Cooperative mode, tasks must be willing to yield the CPU. In Preemptive<br>
              mode, tasks are forced to yield the CPU after 1ms of execution, forcing a context switch.<br><br>

              <b>Memory Protection:</b> As mentioned, tasks are limited to their allocated memory stack. Upon the task's<br>
              creation, a custom malloc() is called, allocating requisite SRAM to the task to use when executing. The<br>
              microcontroller's included MPU is utilized to enforce the R/W privileges of each task, preventing the task from<br>
              using another task's memory, and strictly protecting the Kernel's stack.

              One of the primary purposes of an RTOS is to enable the use of multiple tasks/programs/threads at the "same"<br>
              time. As a result, multiple tasks were created to test the various features of the RTOS described below. These<br>
              tasks do various things. All of these tasks can be found in the files <i><b>tasks.c/h</b></i>:<br><br>

              - Simulating a task that demands a lot of CPU time with <b>LengthyFn()</b>, testing the RTOS's preemptive enforcement.<br>
              - A task that visualizes CPU idle time, <b>Idle()</b>. This task runs in the background at the lowest priority, always<br>
              toggling an LED and yielding the CPU to other tasks. The brightness of the attached LED visually describes<br>
              how idle the CPU is at any given time.<br>
              - Simulating a task with high importance with <b>Important()</b>, testing the RTOS's Priority Inheritance and<br>
              Enforcement. The priority of each task can also be altered during the RTOS's execution.<br>
              - Numerous tasks that simulate the ownership and queuing of semaphores and mutexes.

            Through this project, I developed a strong understanding of real-time operating<br>
            systems and embedded software design. Building the RTOS from scratch sharpened my<br>
            skills in C programming, task scheduling, context switching, and memory protection<br>
            using the MPU. Implementing features such as preemptive and cooperative modes,<br>
            custom stack allocation, and a UART-based shell taught me how low-level hardware<br>
            and OS concepts work together in a reliable system. Working directly with the<br>
            microcontroller, LEDs, and push buttons also strengthened my experience with<br>
            embedded I/O and debugging. Overall, this project solidified my ability to design<br>
            and implement robust, hardware-driven software systems.
