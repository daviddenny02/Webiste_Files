                This project implements a feature-complete, simple Real-Time Operating System. This RTOS
                is created from scratch and driven using a Texas Instruments’ TM4C123GXL Red Board and its
                accompanying microcontroller. Through the use of an UART connection, users can interact with
                the RTOS, which runs multiple sample tasks and threads at the same time, performing quick,
                efficient context switches and requisite memory protection of the Kernel and User Space.

              This page will document the features implemented and available in the RTOS, including the Embedded Systems
              concepts that were applied and tested with it. As previously descibed, the RTOS is run with a TI microprocessor,
              and uses some external hardware in the form of LEDs and Push Buttons for testing and I/O integration experience.
              Also previously described, the primary form of communication between a user and the RTOS is via a UART
              connection, and the various screenshots provided are from the shell implemented with it. With that context in
              mind, here are the features available in the RTOS:

              <b>Shell Interface:</b> Using the UART connection, a shell is implemented, capturing user inputs and interpreting
              those inputs as RTOS commands. These commands include the ability to run/kill tasks, check the status of the RTOS
              with common Linux commands like ps() and ipcs(), reboot the RTOS, etc. The shell is perhaps the most important
              tasks included with the RTOS.<br><br>

              <b>Preemptive and Cooperative Enforcement:</b> The RTOS can operate in both a Cooperative and Preemptive mode,
              toggled using another Shell command. In Cooperative mode, tasks must be willing to yield the CPU. In Preemptive
              mode, tasks are forced to yield the CPU after 1ms of execution, forcing a context switch.<br><br>

              <b>Memory Protection:</b> As mentioned, tasks are limited to their allocated memory stack. Upon the task's
              creation, a custom malloc() is called, allocating requisite SRAM to the task to use when executing. The
              microcontroller's included MPU is utilized to enforce the R/W privileges of each task, preventing the task from
              using another task's memory, and strictly protecting the Kernel's stack.

              One of the primary purposes of an RTOS is to enable the use of multiple tasks/programs/threads at the "same"
              time. As a result, multiple tasks were created to test the various features of the RTOS described below. These
              tasks do various things. All of these tasks can be found in the files <i><b>tasks.c/h</b></i>:<br><br>

              - Simulating a task that demands a lot of CPU time with <b>LengthyFn()</b>, testing the RTOS's preemptive enforcement.<br>
              - A task that visualizes CPU idle time, <b>Idle()</b>. This task runs in the background at the lowest priority, always
              toggling an LED and yielding the CPU to other tasks. The brightness of the attached LED visually describes
              how idle the CPU is at any given time.<br>
              - Simulating a task with high importance with <b>Important()</b>, testing the RTOS's Priority Inheritance and
              Enforcement. The priority of each task can also be altered during the RTOS's execution.<br>
              - Numerous tasks that simulate the ownership and queuing of semaphores and mutexes.

            Through this project, I developed a strong understanding of real-time operating
            systems and embedded software design. Building the RTOS from scratch sharpened my
            skills in C programming, task scheduling, context switching, and memory protection
            using the MPU. Implementing features such as preemptive and cooperative modes,
            custom stack allocation, and a UART-based shell taught me how low-level hardware
            and OS concepts work together in a reliable system. Working directly with the
            microcontroller, LEDs, and push buttons also strengthened my experience with
            embedded I/O and debugging. Overall, this project solidified my ability to design
            and implement robust, hardware-driven software systems.
