                The project includes the creation of a simplified RISC-V processor using an AMD Xilinx Blackboard FPGA, hereby<br>
                referred to as the Blackboard. The Blackboard allows for the creation of this CPU, using the SystemVerilog<br>
                programming language. The goal of this project is to implement a RISC-V processor with a five stage pipeline.<br>
                This pipeline includes the Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execution, Memory, and Writeback stages.<br>
                With all of these stages fully implemented, this processor can run machine code in the form of RISC-V 32-bit<br>
                instructions from compiled C and Assembly programs. The creation of this processor has enabled the understanding<br>
                of the inner workings of computer processors and their implementation in real-world systems.

                As mentioned previously, the code implementing this processor<br>
                was written in the SystemVerilog programming language. The individual<br>
                .sv files make up the various stages and components of the RISC-V<br>
                five-stage pipeline, with the <i>riscv_cpu.sv</i> file being the<br>
                top-level module instantiating them all. These files were written and<br>
                compiled together within the Vivado IDE.<br>
                These files can also be found on my GitHub:<br>

              Milestones of the processor’s implementation were facilitated through multiple labs, in which components of<br>
              the processor were added over time. As such, the following descriptions of each lab describe the features of<br>
              the processor that were implemented over time, enabling the operation of the processor's functionality. This<br>
              functionality was proven with multiple programs during the project’s demonstration. What follows is a<br>
              description of the various features implemented in each lab to ultimately satisfy this project’s goals:<br><br>

              <b><u>Lab 1</u>:</b> ALU implementation: This lab involved the creation of the processor’s arithmetic logic<br>
              unit, enabling the majority of instructions to be executed by the processor. The ALU is utilized by the<br>
              Execution stage of the RISC-V Processor’s pipeline to execute various instructions as needed.<br><br>

              <b><u>Lab 2</u>:</b> Register Interfacing Implementation: This lab involved the creation and interfacing<br>
              of the processor’s register interface. This involved the declaration of the processor’s 32 working<br>
              registers to be used by the various programs run on the processor. It should be noted that register $zero,<br>
              or reg0_data, is to always hold a value of zero. Future labs that implement data-forwarding have been<br>
              altered to never forward non-zero values from $zero when running programs on my implementation of the<br>
              RISC-V processor. This register interface is utilized by various stages of the processor’s pipeline to<br>
              retrieve the values held at the working registers.<br><br>

              <b><u>Lab 3</u>:</b> Memory Interfacing Implementation: This lab involved the creation and interfacing of<br>
              the processor’s memory. Due to the restrictions of the Blackboard’s hardware, my implementation of the<br>
              processor memory space is limited to 16kB, which is more than enough memory space for the goals of this<br>
              processor. This lab enabled the storing of values to this memory space. This memory space operates on the<br>
              processor’s 32-bit functionality. As such, the storage of data to this memory has been altered to allow for<br>
              storing data as bytes (8 bits), half-words (16-bits), and words (32-bits) to various memory addresses as<br>
              available through the use of data shifters. This memory interface is most utilized by the Memory stage of the<br>
              RISC-V pipeline, but many elements of its implementation are reused to declare a dedicated I/O space,<br>
              demonstrated by the flash.s file on my processor’s implementation. This I/O space resembles the dedicated<br>
              memory space on various microcontrollers that are dedicated to the controller’s on-board I/O.<br><br>

              <b><u>Lab 4</u>:</b> Pipeline Implementation: This lab served to provide the foundational wiring of the<br>
              RISC-V pipeline. Most importantly, this portion of the project’s implementation involved the permanent<br>
              creation of each of the pipeline’s stages’ top-level files. Establishing the essential wiring and operation<br>
              of the pipeline’s stages was essential to add on the additional functionality and features of each of the<br>
              stages to be discussed. By the end of this lab’s implementation, we were able to execute instructions in<br>
              succession with the processor, so long as there were requisite dummy operations (NOPs) between them. Below is<br>
              a loose diagram of the implemented pipeline after this lab’s implementation:

            <p>
              <b><u>Lab 5</u>:</b> Register Data Forwarding: This lab enabled the operation of register instructions in<br>
              succession without the need of NOPs between them. By data-forwarding data from future stages in the<br>
              pipeline, our processor’s ID stage was able to send requisite register data to future stages to prevent<br>
              register data hazards.<br><br>

              <b><u>Lab 6</u>:</b> Jump and Branch Logic Implementation: This lab enabled the execution of branch and<br>
              jump instructions, which simply alter the program counter’s functionality in the IF stage. This lab also<br>
              showcased a flaw in the pipeline, requiring us to stall (send a NOP) to the pipeline when a jump occurs.<br>
              This lab majorly altered the implementation of the ID stage to allow for this branching functionality.<br><br>

              <b><u>Lab 7</u>:</b> Memory Pipeline Implementation: This lab allowed for the programs run on the processor<br>
              to finally use load and store instructions, interacting with the processor’s memory as needed. Most simply,<br>
              this lab enabled the usage of Lab 3’s Memory Implementation in the processor’s overall pipeline. Note that<br>
              a prominent issue in this stage in the processor’s implementation is that memory data hazards exist. These<br>
              hazards will be answered by the eigth and final lab:<br><br>

              <b><u>Lab 8</u>:</b> Memory Data Forwarding: This lab enabled the execution of memory stores and loads<br>
              without the need of NOPs between them. This lab involved the creation of stall logic and the data<br>
              forwarding of data from the WB stage to the EX stage in order to optimize the speed of the processor.<br>
              Additionally, some more data-forwarding was added to the EX stage in order to operate on the most<br>
              up-to-date register values in EX, avoiding the need for the ID stage to act upon the inputted rs1/rs2<br>
              data values.<br><br>

              With the completion of this final lab, the RISC-V processor is in a state in which the majority of Assembly<br>
              and C programs can be run on it by altering the initial state of the processor’s RAM, loading various<br>
              programs upon it. The following photos showcase the processor running a requisite program (flash.s) and<br>
              a sample of the ILA for my implementation of the RISC-V processor.

              The creation of this RISC-V processor has allowed me to better understand the<br>
              functionality of a computer’s processor, and the various ways in which the<br>
              pipeline operates upon it. In addition to being an extremely good exercise in<br>
              SystemVerilog programming, this project has enabled my understanding of the<br>
              creation of processor design utilized in modern-day systems.
